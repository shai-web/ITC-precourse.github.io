            <H1> About Me</H1>
            <p>
            My name is Shai Spitzen.
            I actually came across coding from a very different angle. Was working on a site for <a href="https://yahasim.org.il" target="_blank"> my own non-profit </a>. 
            This adventure is still going on, but through the process i fell in love with
            the way cyber and human systems are osculating, and wanted to learn how to control these systems. 
            So here I am - working hard to understand and actualize this tangentation  for the benefit of human-kind.</p>

            <h2>About My experice</h2> 
            <p>
            so actually I have mostly the <a href="https://yahasim.org.il" target="_blank">non-profit's site</a> to show
            right now, but hopefuly within a few months, this portfolio is going to be long and 
            impressive enough.</p>

        <h2>My Geographical Experience</h2>

        <p>
        <ol id="geography-list"> I was born in <li>North Jerusalem</li>, Israel, lived there for 18 years and moved to a quite neighboorhood in <li>Karmiel</li> for my Practical Engineering degree in Cinema and Photography. In 21 I moved to <li>London</li> for 8 months and then came back to <li>Jerusalem</li>, to live in a more central location  for a for two years, which after them lived on the <li>Netherlands</li> and since I came back in 26, I live in <li>South Jerusalem</li>. But I usaully stay a night or two a week in <li>Tel-Aviv</li>.
